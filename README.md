# BFLOG

Brute force remote logging

## Why

I've got a raspberry pi that keeps locking up, and despite my best efforts I can't get the netconsole module to load, it doesn't give me any errors it just doesn't do anything.

## But

What about systemd-journal-remote? Well, simply put I don't have systemd running on any other system.
